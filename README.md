## Introduction

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm focused on training agents to make decisions by interacting with their environment to maximize cumulative rewards. This repository provides several projects that explore various RL techniques and algorithms, from classic methods to more advanced approaches. Whether you're new to RL or an experienced practitioner, these projects offer valuable insights and practical examples.

## Projects

The repository is organized into the following projects:

1. **[CartPole](./CartPole)**: A classic RL problem where the objective is to balance a pole on a cart. This project features implementations of Q-learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN).

2. **[MountainCar](./MountainCar)**: Focuses on the MountainCar problem where a car must build up momentum to reach the top of a hill. The project explores Q-learning and Policy Gradient methods.

3. **[LunarLander](./LunarLander)**: Involves the LunarLander environment where the goal is to land a spacecraft on a designated landing pad. Techniques used include DQN and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).

4. **[CustomEnv](./CustomEnv)**: Demonstrates how to create and train RL agents in a custom environment. Provides a template for users to define their own environments.

5. **[GridWorld](./GridWorld)**: A grid-based environment where agents learn to navigate to a goal while avoiding obstacles. Includes implementations of Value Iteration and Policy Iteration.

6. **[Atari](./Atari)**: Applies RL techniques to Atari 2600 games, featuring implementations of DQN and Experience Replay.
