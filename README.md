## Introduction

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a framework for solving control tasks (also known as decision problems) by developing agents that learn from interacting with their environment. These agents improve their behavior through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties as feedback. This repository contains several projects that explore a range of RL techniques and algorithms, from foundational methods to advanced approaches. Whether you're new to RL or an experienced practitioner, these projects offer valuable insights and practical examples.

## Projects

This repository includes the following projects:

1. **[CartPole](./CartPole)**: A classic RL problem where the objective is to balance a pole on a cart. This project features implementations of Q-learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN).

2. **[MountainCar](./MountainCar)**: Focuses on the MountainCar problem where a car must build up momentum to reach the top of a hill. The project explores Q-learning and Policy Gradient methods.

3. **[LunarLander](./LunarLander)**: Involves the LunarLander environment where the goal is to land a spacecraft on a designated landing pad. Techniques used include DQN and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).

4. **[A2CRoboarm](./A2CRoboarm)**: Demonstrates how to implement a robotic arm in the `panda_gym` environment using the A2C policy in reinforcement learning. The robotic arm learns to move towards objects and perform actions like picking things up.

5. **[GridWorld](./GridWorld)**: A grid-based environment where agents learn to navigate to a goal while avoiding obstacles. Includes implementations of Value Iteration and Policy Iteration.

6. **[Atari](./Atari)**: Applies RL techniques to Atari 2600 games, featuring implementations of DQN and Experience Replay.

7. **[Copy of Frozen_lake&Taxi.ipynb](./Copy%20of%20Frozen_lake%26Taxi.ipynb)**: Demonstrates solving classic RL environments: Frozen Lake and Taxi, using Q-learning and Policy Iteration.

8. **[SampleFactoryDoom.ipynb](./SampleFactoryDoom.ipynb)**: Explores RL in the Doom video game using the SampleFactory framework, including setup, training, and evaluation instructions.

9. **[SnowballTarget&Pyramids.ipynb](./SnowballTarget%26Pyramids.ipynb)**: Showcases RL applications in custom environments, Snowball Target and Pyramids, with implementations of DQN and A3C.

10. **[ppo.py](./ppo.py)**: Implements the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, detailing clipping and policy update mechanisms.

11. **[rlusingtransformershopper-half-cheetah.ipynb](./rlusingtransformershopper-half-cheetah.ipynb)**: Explores using Transformers in RL, specifically applied to the Half-Cheetah environment, with details on integration and evaluation.
